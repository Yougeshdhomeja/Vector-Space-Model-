# Vector-Space-Model-
Developed Vector Space Model in order to retrieve relevant documents by tf-idf scoring.

This Model focuses on Vector Space Model(VSM) for information retrieval. You will be
implementing and testing a set of queries using VSM for information retrieval. You need to build
a vector space of features using some specified feature selection techniques. The dimension of the
space will be Rn, the query is also represented in the same feature space. Cosine similarity is used
to compute the similarity between documents and queries. A given threshold can be used to filter
the results for a given query. The threshold should be fixed for a given set for queries.
